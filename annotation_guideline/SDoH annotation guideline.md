# SDoH Annotation Guidelines

### Overview

Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonmedical factors that significantly influence health outcomes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SDoH are "the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes."

The purpose of this study is to identify and classify seven SDoH domain categories and their corresponding subcategories within clinical notes.

For each annotation task, you will be presented with a text segment extracted from a clinical note. Your objective is to select the most relevant SDoH domain category (or categories) and the corresponding subcategory (or subcategories) that best describe the information in the text.

You will first choose one or more options from the following list:

* 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Social resources and connection  
* 🏋🏻‍♀️ Physical activity  
* 💰 General financial status  
* 💼 Employment status  
* 🏠 Housing status  
* 🍽️ Food security status  
* 🛡️ Insurance status  
* 🤷‍♂️ None of the above

After selecting a category, you will be asked to choose one or more subcategories, or select "N/A" if no suitable subcategory applies. 

Finally, you may add optional comments (1-3 sentences) at the end of each annotation task to explain your reasoning or note any ambiguity.

### Steps

1. Read the text segment carefully.  
2. Select the appropriate SDoH category (or categories).  
   * Choose one or more SDoH categories that best apply to the text segment.  
   * Select "None of the above" if the text contains no relevant SDoH information.  
3. (Optional): Add comments.  
   * If you would like to comment on the text segment and its annotation, please use the comment box at the bottom of the annotation task (1-3 sentences).  
4. Select the corresponding SDoH subcategory (or subcategories).  
   * Choose one or more subcategories that apply.  
   * If none are appropriate, select "N/A."  
5. Answer the four follow-up questions about the selected subcategory:

   Q1. Is this SDoH historical or current?

- Indicate whether the text describes a past or present SDoH circumstance.


  Q2. Is this SDoH about the patient, or about the patient's family or others?

- Specify whose situation is being described.


  Q3. Is this SDoH hypothetical or non-hypothetical?

- "Hypothetical" refers to an SDoH mentioned as a suggestion, plan, or conditional statement (e.g. doctor's instruction/recommendation), not an established fact.  
- Examples:  
1. "Pt is motivated and will attempt to be more active and exercise more."  
2. "It's recommended that pt increase physical activity level."  
3. "If all goes well, patient will move into a stable house."

   

   Q4. Should this SDoH be marked as uncertain?

- Mark "Uncertain" if it is unclear or indeterminate whether the patient actually experiences the SDoH.  
- Examples:  
  1. A SDoH-related question is asked, but no answer is recorded.  
     2. A SDoH-related question is asked, but the answer is "Pended."  
        3. "It may be the case that pt is homeless."  
        4. "pt is asked about the possibility of getting evicted"  
             
6. Submit your annotation.  
   * Click the blue "Submit" button at the bottom of the interface or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl \+ Enter.  
7. Review or update your annotation (if needed).  
   * You may navigate between tasks and revise previous annotations using the left/right arrow buttons at the top of the annotation interface.

### SDoH definitions & examples

#### 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 **Social resources and connection**

**Definition**:  
**Social resources and connection (SRC)** is defined as the degree to which a person has social ties or relationships with, or one feels they have the social support from, other individuals, groups, or organizations. The lack of such resources and connection would be a state of loneliness with lack of interaction with others and those detached and isolated with no help or support system [\[1\]](https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=7614670&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

**Subcategories**:

* Good Social Resources and Connection  
  * Indicates that the individual has positive social relationships, engages socially, or feels emotionally supported by others.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt has a supportive family"

      → *Current, Patient, Not hypothetical, Not uncertain*

    * "If pt has a supportive family they would be in a much better position"

      → *Current, Patient, Hypothetical, Not uncertain*

* Poor Social Resources and Connection  
  * Indicates that the individual lacks or feels they lack adequate social relationships or support from others (e.g., family, friends, community).  
    * Note: Relationship conflict alone does not necessarily indicate poor social connection, especially when social engagement is still maintained.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt feels alone, emotionally isolated"

      → *Current, Patient, Not hypothetical, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt's father is very lonely"

      → *Current, Family, Not hypothetical, Not uncertain*

* Living With or Accompanied by Family/Friends  
  * Indicates that the individual lives with others, or comes to the hospital accompanied by others (e.g., family or friends).  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt lives with their spouse who accompanies her today"

      → *Current, Patient, Not hypothetical, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt appears to be living with some friends"

      → *Current, Patient, Not hypothetical, Uncertain*

* Living Alone  
  * Indicates that the individual lives alone.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt used to live alone until early last year"

      *→ Historical, Patient, Not hypothetical, Not uncertain*

#### 🏋🏻‍♀️ Physical activity

**Definition**:  
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines **physical activity (PA)** as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. PA encompasses all types of movement, including activity performed during leisure time, transportation (e.g., walking or cycling), or occupational tasks. In this study, PA includes both unstructured daily activities (e.g., commuting, recreational walking, occupational PA) and structured activities (e.g., exercise routines, sports participation, or gym workouts) [\[2\]](https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=5843599&pre=&suf=&sa=0).

**Subcategories**:

* Physically Active  
  * Indicates that the individual participates in physical activities (light, moderate, or vigorous) on a regular basis, such as walking, exercising, or playing sports.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt is active and plays basketball once a week"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt is encouraged to exercise more on a regular basis"

      → *Current, Hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Not/barely Physically Active  
  * Indicates that the individual is physically inactive, engages in minimal physical activity, or demonstrates a sedentary lifestyle.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt self-described as physically inactive"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "How much vigorous exercise do you do a week?" *(No response provided in the text segment.)*

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Uncertain*

#### 💼 Employment status

**Definition**:  
**Employment status** reflects a person's current work situation, including whether they are employed, unemployed, retired, or unable to work. Multiple aspects of employment, such as job stability, work environment, financial compensation, and job demands, can significantly influence health. 

In this study, we aim to identify mentions of employment-related conditions in clinical notes, ranging from stable employment to unemployment and other forms of employment instability.

**Subcategories**:

* Stable Employment  
  * Indicates that the individual has stable, full-time employment or long-term job security.  
  * Example:  
    * "Occupation: Full time employment"

      *→ Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      

* Unemployment  
  * Indicates that the individual is not currently working or out of employment.  
    * Note: This category can overlap with "Job loss", but not all unemployment implies recent or acute job loss (which may have distinct health implications).  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt is not currently working"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt is receiving unemployment assistance"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt was recently fired and is now out of work"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Also a mention of "Job loss")*

    * "Pt is not currently working due to disabled status"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Also a mention of "Disability and inability to work")*

      

* Job Loss  
  * Indicates that the individual involuntarily lost or is losing a job, regardless of whether they have since found new employment (e.g., laid off, fired, furloughed).  
    * May overlap with "Unemployment."  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt recently got laid off"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt recently got laid off and is now unemployed"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Also a mention of "Unemployment")*

    * "Pt recently got laid off and is now self-employed"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Not a mention of "Unemployment")*

* Disability and Inability to Work  
  * Indicates that the individual cannot work due to disability or is receiving disability benefits.  
    * May overlap with  "Unemployment."  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt is not currently working due to disabled status"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Also a mention for "Unemployment")*

    * "Occupation: unemployed, on disability"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

      *(Also a mention for "Unemployment")*

      

* Retirement  
  * Defined as voluntary cessation of active employment, typically due to age or financial readiness, resulting in a sustained period of non-employment.  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt has been retired since 2022"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Other Job Insecurity and Employment Issues  
  * Covers other employment instability problems such as being underemployed (e.g., poverty-wage employment and intermittent employment), or general descriptions of job insecurity such as "employment difficulties / problems / issues."  
  * Examples:  
    * "Remains underemployed working 8 hours a week"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt is depressed due to employment difficulties"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

#### 🏠 Housing status

**Definition**:  
Access to stable housing is a critical SDoH that influences both mental and physical well-being. **Housing** instability encompasses a number of challenges, including difficulty paying rent, overcrowding, frequent relocations, or spending a disproportionate share of household income on housing [\[3,4\]](https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=5399100,5051930&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0). Such instability can significantly affect health outcomes and access to care.

**Subcategories**:

* Secure / Quality Housing  
  * Indicates that the individual has stable, adequate, and safe housing (e.g., house, apartment, or other long-term residence).  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt is stably housed"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Homeless / Transitional Housing  
  * Indicates unsheltered homelessness or living in temporary or transitional accommodations that is considered as temporary housing (e.g., halfway house, Oxford house, boarding home).   
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt doesn't have a home and sleeps on the street"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt works in an NGO to help the homeless" 

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Others, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt was in a homeless shelter in the past but has a place to live now"

      → *Historical, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Is pt homeless?"  *(No response provided)*

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Uncertain*

    * "Pt lived in a halfway house last year and has since then left"

      → *Historical, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Subsidized / Public Housing  
  * Indicates that the individual receives government-sponsored housing assistance or lives in government managed housing, such as low-income housing, housing vouchers, or mortgage assistance programs.  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt currently lives in Boston public housing" 

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Other Housing Instability Problems  
  * Covers all other housing-related challenges or instability events, such as eviction, foreclosure, flooding, or losing one's home, as well as broader descriptions (e.g., "unstable housing" or "inadequate housing").  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt is getting evicted"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Uncertain*

#### 🍽️ Food security status

**Definition**:  
**Food security** refers to having reliable and consistent access to adequate food necessary to maintain a healthy and active life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), food security is a key SDoH. Both food security and food insecurity relate not only to the availability of food, but also to the financial and material means required to obtain it consistently.

**Subcategories**:

* Food Security  
  * Indicates that the individual has no problems or concerns about consistently accessing adequate food.  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt has access to food"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Food Insecurity  
  * Indicates limited or uncertain access to adequate food, including lack of food in general or reliance on assistance programs such as food stamps, food pantries, food banks, or soup kitchens.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Inadequate food at home"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt's mom is receiving food assistance"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Family, Not uncertain*

#### 🛡️ Health insurance status

**Definition**:  
Inadequate **health insurance** coverage is one of the largest barriers to healthcare access, and the unequal distribution of coverage contributes to disparities in health [\[5\]](https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=2388359&pre=&suf=&sa=0). Conversely, research shows that having health insurance is associated with improved access to health services and better health monitoring [\[6-8\]](https://sciwheel.com/work/citation?ids=4799808,3362368,743011&pre=&pre=&pre=&suf=&suf=&suf=&sa=0,0,0). Here we aim to identify mentions of adequate insurance coverage, lack of insurance, and government-assisted insurance within clinical notes.

**Subcategories**:

* Adequate Insurance Coverage  
  * Indicates that the individual has adequate health insurance coverage.  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt is currently insured"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Lack of Insurance  
  * Indicates that the individual is uninsured, underinsured, or experiencing difficulty with insurance coverage.  
  * Examples:  
    * "Pt feels stressed because pt's brother is underinsured"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Family, Not uncertain*

    * "Pt is having trouble with insurance before going to treatment"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Government-Assisted Insurance  
  * Indicates that the individual receives health insurance through government or charitable programs designed for people with limited income or resources (e.g., Medicaid, MassHealth).  
    * Note: Medicare and Medigap are not included in this category.    
  * Example:  
    * "Pt has MassHealth"

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

#### 💰 General financial status

**Definition**:  
**General financial status** refers to an individual's overall economic stability and access to financial resources. It captures both objective indicators (e.g., ability to pay for basic needs) and subjective perceptions of financial strain or stability. Unlike other SDoH domains (e.g., employment or housing), this category focuses on general financial capability and well-being.

**Subcategories**:

* General Financial Security  
  * Indicates that the individual is financially stable, economically secure, or has adequate income to meet essential needs.  
  * Example:  
    * "Pt and her family are financially secure, and her husband's job loss is not a problem for the family." 

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Patient, Not uncertain*

* Financial Insecurity  
  * Indicates that the individual cannot afford basic needs or feels financial strain due to economic hardship or instability.  
  * Example:  
    * "Mom is currently struggling with financial stability and is worried about her ability to pay the next rent." 

      → *Current, Not hypothetical, Family, Not uncertain*

### 

### Q\&A

Q: *Can I select **multiple SDoH** categories or subcategories for a given text segment?*  
A: Yes. If multiple SDoH domains are mentioned in the text, select all that apply. Example: If a text states that the patient does not have enough food because they cannot afford it, select both "Food insecurity" and "Financial insecurity."

Q: *What if the patient lost their job and is currently unemployed? Which sub-categories from "Employment status" should I select?*  
A: Select both "Unemployment" and "Job loss".

Q: *What should I do with **questionnaires** mentioned in the text?*  
A: Use the questionnaire answers (if present) to determine the appropriate SDoH category. If no answers are provided, select "None of the above."

Q: *The text seems to describe a **recommendation**, such as a clinician advising the patient to increase physical activity. How should I annotate this?*  
A: We have attempted to remove purely recommendation-based content, as it does not reflect the patient's current status. However, if you think the SDoH information in the text originates from a recommendation or suggestion rather than an actual condition, mark it as "Hypothetical."

Q: *What does "proxy-rptd" mean?*  
A: Proxy-reported (proxy-rptd) means the information was reported by someone other than the patient, such as a family member or caregiver.

Q: *Should "Pt has 2 children" be considered an instance of "Good Social Resources and Connection"?*  
A: Not necessarily. Simply mentioning children does not imply that they are available or a source of social support. To count as "Good Social Resources and Connection," the text should explicitly indicate *social support, proximity, or interaction*.
